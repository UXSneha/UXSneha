					<h4>
						Court Booking App for Seamless Scheduling – Both players and club employees should have the
						ability to book the court.
					</h4>
					<br>
					<p>
						A few of my developer friends encountered challenges when trying to book a court at a nearby
						club. This sparked the idea of developing an app to address the issue. We also discovered that
						both Tennis club members and the club staff faced similar difficulties, so we decided to create
						a solution by building this app.

									<h3>Define</h3>
									<h4>Crafting the Problem Statement</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									After engaging in discussions with 6 club members and 2 club managers, we identified
									key
									features to enhance the app. These include functionalities like creating a
									tournament, finding a
									game partner, and forming game groups within the app.
								</p>
								<p>
									We recognized that each user would have different levels of access to the app’s
									features. Based
									on this, we outlined four distinct personas, each with specific permissions to
									perform various
									activities within the app.
								</p>
								<p>
									These new features aim to enhance user engagement, foster a sense of community, and
									make it
									easier for players to connect and organize games.
								</p>


							</div>

						</div>

						<h4>The four primary personas using the app are as follows:</h4>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Member:</strong> A regular club member who can book courts, join tournaments,
								and
								connect with other players.</li>
							<li><strong>Non-Member:</strong> A guest player who can book courts for a one-time session
								but
								has limited access to additional features like tournaments and game groups.</li>
							<li><strong>Admin:</strong> Club staff responsible for managing court bookings, tournaments,
								and
								ensuring smooth operations within the app.</li>
							<li><strong>Coach:</strong> Certified trainers who can organize training sessions, find game
								partners, and track player progress.</li>
						</ul>

						<header class="major">
							<h4>IDEATE – Brainstorming Bold Solutions</h4>
						</header>
						<p>
							During the Ideation phase, I focused on creating low-fidelity mockups for the key screens in
							the app. The goal was to quickly visualize and refine design ideas before moving into more
							detailed prototyping. Key activities included:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Low-Fidelity Mockups:</strong> Created basic wireframes to represent the core
								functionality and user flow.</li>
							<li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Conducted preliminary validation by walking through the
								mockups with a few users to gather early insights.</li>
							<li><strong>Identify Pain Points:</strong> Recognized that the court booking screen required
								further refinement, as users felt the layout was not intuitive enough.</li>
							<li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Based on the feedback, I identified areas for improvement,
								particularly focusing on simplifying the booking process and enhancing overall
								usability.</li>
						</ul>
						<span class="image fit"> <img src="images/BMS/BMS1.png" alt=""> </span>
						<header class="major">
							<h4>PROTOTYPE – Visualizing the Concept</h4>
						</header>
						<p>
							In the Prototype phase, I moved from low-fidelity wireframes to creating more polished
							designs in Figma. This was essential for translating the concepts into a usable prototype.
							Key activities included:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Main Screen Focus:</strong> The main screen, which serves as the user's primary
								interaction point, was designed with clear focus areas.</li>
							<li><strong>Design Iterations:</strong> Tried several design variations based on feedback
								from users and insights from similar apps.</li>
							<li><strong>Remote Usability Testing:</strong> Conducted a remote usability test with 7
								users to assess the design’s effectiveness and ease of use. Based on their feedback, the
								design for the schedule selection page was finalized.</li>
							<li><strong>Refinement:</strong> Focused on fine-tuning the layout and interactivity based
								on real user behavior and preferences.</li>
						</ul>

						<span class="image fit"> <img src="images/BMS/BMSHF.png" alt=""> </span>

						<header class="major">
							<h4>TEST – Evaluating and Iterating on Ideas</h4>
						</header>
						<p>
							Testing played a crucial role in evaluating the design's impact and identifying areas for
							further iteration. Activities in this phase included:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Dark vs Light Mode Testing:</strong> Evaluated user preferences for dark and
								light modes, ensuring that both options were intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
							<li><strong>User Responses:</strong> Gathered feedback on how users responded to the screen
								modes, with a focus on overall experience and comfort.</li>
							<li><strong>Feature Suggestion:</strong> Developers suggested adding a toggle for users to
								switch between Dark and Light modes, giving users more control over their app
								experience.</li>
						</ul>
						<span class="image fit"> <img src="images/BMS/BMSCR.png" alt=""> </span>

						<header class="major">
							<h4>Next Phase – Shaping the Future Based on Insights</h4>
						</header>
						<p>
							As the design evolved, it was important to implement insights gained from user testing. The
							following steps were taken:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Design Iteration - 1: Dark vs Light Screen:</strong> Based on user feedback, we
								moved forward with the idea of incorporating Dark and Light modes into the app.</li>
							<li><strong>Accessibility Standards:</strong> Realized the need to prioritize accessibility
								in design. Some users found it difficult to interact with the app due to an overuse of
								greens and reds, so we made adjustments to improve readability and visual comfort.</li>
							<li><strong>Color Palette Redesign:</strong> Redesigned the color palette to meet
								accessibility standards. The new colors were inspired by tennis balls and court shades,
								offering a visually pleasant and inclusive experience for all users.</li>
							<li><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> The changes ensured that the app would be
								accessible to a wider range of users, including those with color vision deficiencies.
							</li>
						</ul>

								<h3>DESIGN ITERATION - 4</h3>
							</header>
							<h4>CHANGE OF COLOR PALETTE</h4>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Implementing Accessibility Standards:</strong> At this stage, we decided to
									prioritize accessibility in the design process.</li>
								<li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> During testing, one user mentioned difficulty using
									the app due to the overuse of greens and reds, which caused visual discomfort.</li>
								<li><strong>Color Palette Redesign:</strong> In response to this, I redesigned the color
									palette to adhere to accessibility standards, ensuring better usability for all
									users.</li>
								<li><strong>Color Inspiration:</strong> The updated palette was inspired by the colors
									of tennis balls and court shades, providing a visually harmonious experience.</li>
