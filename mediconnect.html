				<p>Through this project, I explored creating an intuitive user experience that addressed critical
					healthcare needs. My subsequent <a href="chatbotchronicles.html#three">Chatbot Chronicles</a>
					case
					study builds on these principles, showcasing a bot designed for seamless medical consultations.
				</p>

				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>The users of this product would include:</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Step 1: Understanding the problem</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/4.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>I began by conducting a brain dump, jotting down all the words and thoughts that came to mind
					when
					thinking about visiting a medical practitioner. During this phase, I worked closely with a
					multidisciplinary team, participating in brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and concepts
					for
					the healthcare application. Together, we explored a range of possibilities and crafted
					innovative
					solutions to tackle the challenges and pain points uncovered through user experience research.
				</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/5.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Next, we mapped out the user journey, focusing on a scenario where Philip, a user, falls down and
					needs to plan a visit to the doctor. We outlined the steps Philip would take—from realizing the
					need
					for medical attention to scheduling an appointment. The goal was to create a smooth and
					intuitive
					process for users like Philip to quickly and easily seek medical help, with minimal friction,
					leveraging the app’s features to guide him through each step of the journey.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/6.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Next, we designed a process flow that involved all key stakeholders: the doctor, the admin, and
					the
					patient. The flow illustrated how each stakeholder interacts with the system:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Patient:</b> Initiates the process by logging into the app, selecting the type of
						consultation needed, and scheduling an appointment with the doctor.</li>
					<li><b>Admin:</b> Manages the backend, ensuring that appointments are scheduled, patient data is
						correctly recorded, and doctors' availability is updated in real time.</li>
					<li><b>Doctor:</b> Receives appointment notifications, reviews patient information, and prepares
						for
						consultations, either through video or in-person. After the consultation, the doctor updates
						the
						patient’s records and provides prescriptions or follow-up care instructions.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This flow ensures that all parties are aligned and can efficiently communicate and complete their
					tasks, streamlining the medical consultation process.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/7.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>So far, we've explored the ideal scenario; now let's examine the pain points.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/8.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>The most effective approach would be to create a persona...</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/9.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/10.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Doctor Persona</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/11.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/12.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>While creating personas for users like doctors and patients was essential to address their
					specific
					needs, we did not create a persona for the admin. This was because the admin’s role was more
					system-oriented, involving tasks like managing data, monitoring user activity, and ensuring
					smooth
					operation, which didn’t require a personalized approach. Instead, the focus was on defining the
					admin’s functional needs and system requirements to enhance their efficiency.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/13.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>I next moved to the research phase, where I conducted competitive research and explored emerging
					trends in the medical field, such as advancements in telemedicine, the integration of AI in
					diagnostics, and the growing demand for seamless patient experiences through digital health
					solutions</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/14.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>One quote that really resonated with me during this phase!</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/15.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Through my research, I uncovered several key insights, including the fact that 80% of patients
					prefer
					digital tools for managing their healthcare, and the global telemedicine market is expected to
					grow
					to $185.6 billion by 2026. These findings helped shape the design strategy and ensure alignment
					with
					current industry needs and user expectations.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/16.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Now, it's time to bring all the insights and research together into designs and prototyping—the
					phase
					I truly enjoy. This is where the concepts evolve into tangible, user-centered solutions,
					allowing me
					to craft intuitive interfaces and seamless experiences that address the needs of all
					stakeholders.
					It’s the part of the process where creativity and strategy meet, and I can see the design taking
					shape into something both functional and impactful.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/17.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/18.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>The ideal solution for a patient would be an app that makes reaching out to healthcare providers
					just
					a click away. To achieve this, I designed a user-friendly dashboard where all relevant
					information
					is easily accessible. This dashboard consolidates key features in one place, streamlining the
					process for users and ensuring they have a seamless experience when seeking medical assistance
					or
					managing their healthcare needs.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/19.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>For the doctor, it's essential to have a comprehensive, bird's-eye view of the patient's
					information
					on a desktop interface, ensuring that no detail or potential issue is overlooked. This allows
					the
					doctor to quickly assess the patient's history, current concerns, and treatment plan, empowering
					them to make informed decisions and provide effective care without missing any critical
					information.
				</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/20.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/21.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>The admin, on the other hand, would benefit from a tablet or desktop interface that provides an
					organized view of what's needed for smooth operations. This platform would allow the admin to
					easily
					manage appointments, track patient data, and oversee doctor availability, ensuring that
					everything
					is running efficiently and that all stakeholders have the information they need at a glance.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/22.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>After the paper sketching phase, I moved on to defining what would visually appeal to the user
					and
					how the information architecture would be structured to ensure a seamless experience. This phase
					was
					crucial in setting a strong foundation for the design.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/25.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Additionally, as part of this project, I worked on integrating a chatbot that would assist users
					by
					providing quick access to medical information and services. This chatbot was designed to enhance
					the
					user experience by facilitating efficient interactions between patients and healthcare
					providers.
					You can explore more about this in my <a href="chatbotchronicles.html#three">Chatbot
						Chronicles</a>
					case study.</p>

				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/23.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Mid-level mockup created in Balsamiq for the admin interface.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/27.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/28.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/29.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/30.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/31.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<ul>
					<p> Here are a few key learnings from this project:</p>

					<li><b>Importance of User-Centric Design:</b> The entire process reinforced how critical it is
						to
						design with the user in mind, ensuring that their needs and pain points are addressed
						effectively.</li>
					<li><b>Collaboration is Key:</b> Working with a multidisciplinary team helped refine the design,
						allowing us to leverage diverse perspectives to create a more holistic solution.</li>
					<li><b>Iterative Design Process:</b> The iterative nature of design, from brainstorming to
						prototyping, allowed us to continuously improve and adapt the product based on feedback and
						testing.</li>
					<li><b>Design Systems:</b> Implementing a consistent design system not only streamlined
						development
						but also ensured a cohesive user experience across platforms.</li>
				</ul>




				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/32.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>The implementation phase was all about transforming the design vision into reality. This involved
					close collaboration with developers to ensure every feature and interaction was seamlessly
					integrated into the system, effectively addressing the pain points identified during research
					and
					design.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/26.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<p> Below is the prototype of the app. You can click <a
						href="https://www.figma.com/proto/WGPcmiqpBW8t9rhcm43EQ4/Medical?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=0-3047&starting-point-node-id=0%3A3047&t=lZALVni0mwc6XubH-1"
						target="_blank">here</a> to explore an interactive mockup.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/Mediconnect.png" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Please note that while this version reflects the design at the time of the project launch, our
					design system and color scheme were further updated afterward. Unfortunately, I do not have
					access to those updates.</p>

				<p>After going live, the evaluation phase focused on gathering user feedback and monitoring
					performance
					metrics. This allowed us to refine the product further, ensuring it continued to meet user needs
					and
					deliver meaningful impact.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/EC/33.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>In conclusion, this project has been an exciting journey of learning and growth, where I was able
					to
					apply my design skills to a real-world healthcare solution. It provided valuable insights into
					creating user-friendly, efficient, and impactful experiences for both patients and healthcare
					providers.</p>
