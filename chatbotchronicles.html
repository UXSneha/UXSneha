							<h3>Project 1</h3>
							<h4>Chatbot for Real Estate (2019)</h4>
						</header>

						<div class="row">

							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<b>Overview:</b>
								<p>
									In 2014, recognizing an opportunity to enhance user engagement and streamline the
									property search process, I undertook a project to improve CommonFloor,
									one of India’s leading real estate platforms. Through research and collaboration
									with the product and engineering teams, I conceptualized and designed a chatbot that
									acted as a static virtual assistant, simplifying navigation and decision-making for
									prospective property buyers and renters.
								</p>
								<b>Objective:</b>
								<ul>
									To design a chatbot experience that:
									<li>Simplifies property search for users unfamiliar with online real estate
										platforms.</li>
									<li>Provides curated property recommendations based on user inputs.</li>
									<li>Reduces user dropout rates caused by overwhelming property listings.</li>
									</p>
								</ul>
								<b>User Research:</b>
								<ul>
									<li>Target Audience: First-time homebuyers and renters, typically aged 25–40,
										with limited
										familiarity with digital tools.</li>
									<li>Many users expressed a preference for conversational interfaces that mimic human
										interactions, helping them feel more confident and less overwhelmed during the
										property search process.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<b>Insights Gathered:</b>
								<ul>
									<li>Users were overwhelmed by the extensive listings and filters on the platform.
									</li>
									<li>Many preferred guided interactions rather than open-ended searches.</li>
									<li>A significant number of users abandoned the search due to difficulty in finding
										relevant
										properties quickly.</li>
								</ul>
								<b>Challenges:</b>
								<ul>
									<li><i>Navigation Complexity:</i> Simplifying the process for users unfamiliar with
										real estate
										terminologies.</li>
									<li><i>Fixed Inputs:</i> The chatbot was limited to rule-based interactions and
										couldn’t process
										free-form user queries.</li>
									<li><i>Curated Recommendations:</i> Offering meaningful property suggestions without
										extensive
										user
										input.</li>
								</ul>

							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/CBAI/dataflow.png"
											alt="" /></span>
								</div>
								<p>The decision tree in this case helps simplify complex problems by breaking down the
									property search process into clear, manageable steps. It guides users through a
									structured journey for buying, selling, or renting properties, making it easier to
									navigate through various decisions like location, budget, and property type. By
									visualizing the flow, it reduces decision fatigue and eliminates ambiguity, allowing
									users to focus on key factors without feeling overwhelmed. This clear, logical
									progression ensures that users can make informed choices quickly, improving their
									overall experience and reducing friction in the process.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<h3>Solution</h3>
						<p>The chatbot was designed as a static, rule-based assistant that provided a guided interaction
							experience.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><i>Predefined Queries:</i> Users selected from dropdown menus to refine their search
								by
								property
								type, location, and budget.</li>
							<li><i>Interactive Filters:</i> The chatbot guided users step-by-step through filtering
								options,
								helping them shortlist properties efficiently.</li>
							<li><i>Quick Recommendations:</i> Based on selected criteria, the chatbot presented 3–5
								curated
								property listings.</li>
						</ul>

						<span class="image fit">
							<img src="images/CBAI/CommonFloor.png" alt="DIY Loan Chatbot Interface">
						</span>

						<div class="row">

							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<b>Interface Design:</b>
								<ul>
									<li><i>Minimalistic UI:</i> Focused on a clean, distraction-free interface that
										emphasized
										dropdowns
										and quick-action buttons.</li>
									<li><i>Responsive Design:</i> Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
									<li><i>Clear Feedback Loops:</i> Users received instant confirmation messages after
										each
										interaction, ensuring clarity.</li>
									<li><i>Accessibility First: </i>Ensured that all interactive elements were
										accessible, with proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen
										reader compatibility.</li>
								</ul>

							</div>

							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<b>Key Learnings:</b>
								<ul>
									<li><i>Simplicity Wins:</i> A guided, rule-based approach outperformed open-ended
										search for
										novice
										users.</li>
									<li><i>Iterative Design:</i> Continuous feedback loops ensured the chatbot met user
										expectations.
									</li>
									<li><i>Scalability:</i> While the chatbot succeeded as a static assistant, it
										highlighted
										the
										need
										for more adaptive, conversational designs in the future.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>

						<b>Reflections:</b>
						<p>
							Although the project didn’t progress to implementation, and CommonFloor does not currently
							have
							a chatbot, the research and design efforts provided critical insights into user behavior and
							preferences. These learnings can be foundational for future explorations in conversational
							AI
							and intelligent property search solutions.

						my
						understanding of how AI can enhance user experiences. I have learned that the key to
						successful
						chatbot design lies in simplicity, adaptability, and context-awareness. While my
						early
						projects
						focused on rule-based systems, my later experiences have shown me the power of more
						dynamic,
						personalized AI systems.</p>

					<p>Looking ahead, I am excited to continue exploring how AI and chatbots can provide
						even
						more
						personalized, intuitive experiences in different industries. From real estate to
						finance
						to
						healthcare, the potential for improving user experiences with AI is immense, and I
						am
						eager
						to
