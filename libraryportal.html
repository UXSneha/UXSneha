					<p>The Accenture Library is a treasure trove of knowledge designed to empower employees with
						resources to enhance their skill sets, expand their vocabulary, deepen their knowledge, or
						simply unwind with a good read. With a wealth of online resources available 24/7 to all active
						employees, the library serves as an invaluable tool for professional and personal growth.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, many employees were unaware of this rich resource within the organization. To address
						this challenge, we embarked on a journey to increase awareness and accessibility by reimagining
						the library portal. This redesign includes a more intuitive web portal and the creation of a
						mobile app featuring frequently accessed URLs, ensuring employees can seamlessly engage with
						library resources anytime, anywhere.</p>

								<h3>Empathize</h3>

							<p>
								<li>Our primary goal was to increase awareness among employees about the library's
									existence.
								</li>
								<li>The target users were the company's internal employees.</li>
								<li>We identified newsletters as an effective medium for spreading awareness using the
									employee
									mailing list.</li>
								<li>Posters were strategically placed across the company to ensure accessibility of key
									information.</li>
								<li>Team events and contests were organized within the library or promoted via
									newsletters to
									engage employees.</li>

									<h4>Crafting the Problem Statement</h4>
								</header>

								<ul>
									<li>Designed posters aligned with the company's branding to be displayed in
										prominent
										employee
										gathering areas.</li>
									<li>Created a newsletter template, which was shared with the project manager for
										distribution
										through the employee mailing list.</li>
									<li>Designed contest circulars to promote library events and engage employees.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									The posters were strategically placed across the company, ensuring maximum
									visibility.
									I designed and implemented a recurring newsletter campaign, branded as "Motivational
									Mondays,"
									which was shared weekly to boost awareness.
									Additionally, engaging contests like crosswords were conducted through emails.
									These efforts successfully increased awareness of the library's resources, and the
									portal began
									receiving significantly higher usage.
									Employees also started actively visiting the library, marking a major milestone in
									the
									initiative.

						<h3>Creating Personas</h3>
						<h4>Translating Insights into Action</h4>
					</header>
			
					<h4>Stakeholder Meeting</h4>
					<p>
						To bridge the gap between research and execution, we collaborated with key stakeholders responsible for the library portal’s development. 
						The core objective was to enhance employee awareness and maximize the utilization of the library’s resources.
					</p>
			
					<h4>User Interviews</h4>
					<p>
						We conducted in-depth interviews with employees who visited the library, selecting six participants with diverse professional backgrounds 
						and reading preferences. These insights helped us identify common pain points and opportunities for improvement.
					</p>
			
					<h4>Personas</h4>
					<p>
						Based on our findings, I developed three user personas—Mary, Peter, and Joshua—each representing different work experiences, 
						reading habits, and motivations for using the library. These personas guided our design decisions by keeping real user needs in focus.

								<h3>03 Ideate</h3>
								<h4>Exploring Design Possibilities</h4>
							</header>
					
							<p>
								We brainstormed multiple ideas and layouts, focusing on minimal yet effective changes to enhance usability. 
								My goal was to retain the essence of the existing portal while improving accessibility and user experience. 
								I began with low-fidelity sketches to map out potential solutions.

							<header class="major">
								<h3>04 Prototype</h3>
								<h4>Bringing Ideas to Life</h4>
							</header>
					
							<p>
								Since we were redesigning an existing portal, I chose to maintain the current typography, color palette, 
								and branding while introducing complementary fonts and colors to improve interaction.
							</p>
					
							<header class="major">
								<h4>Addressing Key Pain Points</h4>
							</header>
					
							<h4>Navigation Issues</h4>
							<p>
								The website had a complex and inconsistent navigation structure, making it difficult for employees to 
								locate resources efficiently. Simplifying the site map and restructuring the information architecture 
								became a top priority.
							</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/LP/LP4.png" alt="Navigation Issues" /></span>
					
							<p>
								After refining the sketches, I collaborated with developers to discuss feasibility, coding constraints, 
								and timelines. We opted to reuse existing components wherever possible to ensure a seamless transition.
							</p>
					
							<p>
								Once the foundational changes were set, I created an interactive prototype for usability testing. 
								I used InVision Studio for rapid collaboration and iteration.
							</p>
					
							<p>
								Analytics indicated that the *borrowing feature* was the most frequently used, aligning with our user personas' needs. 
								Based on this insight, I designed a basic mobile app concept focused on borrowing books, tracking due dates, 
								and receiving availability notifications.
							</p>
					
							<p>
								Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), detailed wireframes cannot be shared, but this case study outlines 
								the methodologies used to solve the design challenges.

								<h3>05 Test</h3>
								<h4>Validating the Design</h4>
							</header>
					
							<p>
								Before final implementation, we conducted usability tests to uncover potential issues and assess user satisfaction.
								A/B testing was conducted with 12 employees to compare the original and redesigned portal.
							</p>
					
							<ul>
								<li>Participants were asked to navigate both versions and provide feedback.</li>
								<li>The goal was to test clarity, ease of use, and overall experience.</li>
								<li>Key performance indicators (KPIs) were broken into measurable tasks.</li>
								<li>Employees provided valuable feedback, including further improvement suggestions.</li>
							</ul>
					
							<p>
								<b><i>How our personas responded to the changes:</i></b>
								<br><b>Mary:</b> "I get notifications and can easily track the books I need!"
								<br><b>Peter:</b> "Navigation is much clearer now, and everything is accessible."
								<br><b>Joshua:</b> "I can share my experiences in the blog section and guide interns outside my team."
